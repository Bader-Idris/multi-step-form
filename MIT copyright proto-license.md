 As a full-stack developer, it's important to be familiar with licensing in software development. One of the most popular open-source licenses for Node.js is the MIT License, which is permissive and gives users a lot of freedom to use the software without restrictions. In this article, we'll discuss the basics of the MIT License and how it applies to Node.js.

 The MIT License is an open-source software license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute software freely, without any restrictions. The license is considered very permissive and allows users to use the software for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. The license is named after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) because it was developed by the university.
