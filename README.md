### Fully Set Multi-Step Form

This is an up and ready **multi-step form** application.

The most difficult project I have ever worked on until the date: **5/6/2023**.

I used almost **85% of all JS** knowledge I have learned, and it took me around a week of hard work. But, the result was worth it!
