### Fully Set Multi-Step Form

This is a **fully set multi-step form** that requires **Node.js** to send data to  `mydata.json`  file. I encountered the most difficult project I have ever worked on until the date: **5/6/2023**.
 I used almost **85% of all JS** knowledge I have learned, and it took me around a week of hard work. But, the result was worth it!
